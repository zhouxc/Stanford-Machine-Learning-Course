    The set of all training state sequences.  train_state[i] is
    an array representing the i-th sequence of states encountered
    during training (corresponding to train_output[i]).

    The set of all training output sequences.  train_output[i] is
    an array representing the i-th sequence of outputs encountered
    during training (corresponding to train_state[i]).
